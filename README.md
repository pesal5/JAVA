# JAVA-for-gui-and-database-And-Machine-Learning-in-Python

## Part 1 - JAVA GUI and Database programming  
      
      1.1 It contains the solution to  gui programming where we are write a JAVA program
          and create the following  form then  show the output of the multiply operation in the OUTPUT label. 
          You can assume the dimensions of each components and frame yourself.

       1.2 It contains the solution to creating a gui as shown below,connect to the database (MSSQL SERVER in this code ) and in the database "Account_Cust" with its corresponding table "Accountslist" perform the following operations:       
            
             a. By clicking the “INSERT” button , Insert the name and details of the persons  with name, account number and  amount in the database  as shown in below table.  
                
             b. Then show the current items from the account table of database in the table by clicking “SHOW TABLE’S CURRENT FIELD VALUES”.You can assume the dimensions of each components and frame.

## Part 2 - Data Anlaysis, Data Preparation and fitting Machine Learning models  according to the nature of the dataset 
             2.1 Data Analysis,Preparation and Model comparison on real Dataset 
                   2.1.1 This folder consists of "PIMA" dataset, cleaned dataset after data cleaning operation and python notebook. 
                   2.1.2 The notebook has explanation to both python code and indepth analysis on data preparation steps i.e. it covers performing  exploratory analysis, statistcal measures and based on such analsyis we are going to choose one preparation step over the other. 
                   2.1.3 After step 2.1.2, the next part then makes the some learning algorithm learn from the cleaned and transformed dataset and then       compares the accuracy score of each algorithm in order to select the best machine learning model for application in that particular dataset.                        
                   2.1.4 Also Confusion Matrix is used in one of the model evaluation to determine number of true and false positves as well as true and   false negatives in unseen dataset to identify the real performance of the model in the test dataset.Then a heatmap plot of the confusion matrix is plotted.                                  
                   
              2.2  Feature Representation Modern vs Conventional-An application of eigen value and vector
                   2.2.1 In this folder ,Face detection using Eigen faces algorithm is implemented. The assocuated theiry and dataset is within this folder.
                   2.2.2 This lab work was done as part of my participation in "2nd Nepal WinterSchool In AI 2019 DECEMBER 10-20,Pokhara" conducted by NAAMII  NEPAL.https://2nepalschool.naamii.com.np/ 
                 
              2.3. Bayesian Classifier Spam Detection 
                   2.3.1 This folder contains the spam email text dataset. The purpose for choosing this dataset is to play with the text data for data       prepation tasks and then feed the cleaned dataset into NavieBayes Classifier to identify the sample text as email or spam.   
                   2.3.2 Naaive Bayes Algorithm is used as a learning model and the jupyter notebook also contains code explanation  as well as the           mathematical details and calculations for data preprocessing and model learning.   
             
             2.4 Linear Models
                  2.4.1 This folder contains SAARC dataset of Nepal's literacy rate for 72 districts and the linear regression algorithm need to predict the literacy rate of some districts isloated as test set, then compare how much accurcy rate of the model predicted  output against the actual value.                       
                  2.4.2. The other python file contains the code and necessray theory to train the Logistic Regression model on "Titanic" dataset.
                  2.4.3  In both of the above model's dataset, data preprocessing and model evalaution is performed and explained. Also in both of the       learning models we emphasized on why accuracy can't solely be considered for model evaluation regardless of its high score. This idea has opened             a new perpective on model's performance based on Accuracy, Precision and Recall. 
                  2.4.5 Both of these tasks were my completed lab works during participation in "2nd Nepal WinterSchool In AI 2019 DECEMBER 10-20,Pokhara"    conducted by NAAMII NEPAL. https://www.naamii.org.np/
